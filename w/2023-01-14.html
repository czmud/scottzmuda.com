            for a moment there i forgot i wanted this to be a place of liberation. well, now i have remembered.
        </p>
        <p>
            i think one way to understand what people are up to, is to see that there are two camps: one entrenched around big things, one entrenched around small.
        </p>
        <p>
            the small things camp loves atoms, and loooOOoooOoOoves the ~quantum realm~. they are quick to tell you that what *really* matters is that you are a bag of atoms.
        </p>
        <p>
            the big things camp is fixated on your ~ultimate destination~ and ETERNITY. they are quick to tell you that what *really* matters is the location of your soul at the END OF THE WORLD.
        </p>
        <p>
            sometimes it feels like there is a wasteland between the big things camp and the small things camp. a desert, vast enough to daunt even the most courageous travelers.
        </p>
        <p>
            perhaps we may breathe some life into this forgotten desolation.
