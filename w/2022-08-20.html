    i have a restlessness that worries me sometimes. like i'm holding my breath until i figure things out, but at the same time knowing that i'll never be able to "figure things out" in the way that i would want. i think this is me trying to hold on to some sort of control as the ground i stand on... but at the same time knowing that this isn't the firm ground that i pretend that it is. in some important ways i have access to knowledge and understanding that was unimaginable 200 years ago, 1,000 years ago, 5,000 years ago... i don't think it makes sense to hold something as essential to life that hasn't historically even been an option for so many. life has to require something different. another way to think about this: i'm trying to do an exhaustive search of the space of possibilities when i instead need to understand how to navigate that space more ~intelligently~. its funny... seeking understanding (as an absolute good) turns out to be an unintelligent strategy it seems.
</p>
<p>
    i think this goes one level deeper because i might respond to this by saying "ok... trying to gain full understanding won't work so instead i'll figure out what the best strategy based on incomplete understanding is and do that!" but here the same problem is faced again. i don't have the ability to sort through all the possible strategies in order to find the best one... another way to say this: i can't have a strategy based on perfect understanding and i also can't have a perfect strategy based on imperfect understanding. what seems to be needed is to develop an imperfect strategy based on imperfect understanding. 
</p>
<p>
    in my mind this leads directly to ideas of orthodoxy vs heterodoxy, conservatism vs liberalism, or reasoning by analogy vs by first principle. what i maybe can do is largely base my strategy and understanding in life on those that lived before me (orthodoxy / conservatism) and those who are living with me (reasoning by analogy) and from this place of stability engage in a more limited exploration of new ideas and practices (heterodoxy / liberalism). this way of living has always been available to all people at all times because it is a way of living that is relative to the culture of the time. but this is not to say that it is an arbitrary way of living because it is still pointed toward some un-comprehendible good (reasoning by first principles). another way to say this might be that we are not called to live an absolute idealistically pure life but are called to refine and improve the meager lot in life we have been given as a starting point.

    (faith might, in part, be the belief that this whole process of cultural/civilizational development can happen at all.)
