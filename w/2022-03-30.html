            ok, i want to write about an idea i've been trying to process for the last little while. i think this will be difficult because in my head things make a lot of sense... not perfect sense, but a lot of sense. but i find that when i try to translate those ideas into words things tend to fall apart a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
            so, here's an outline of what i want to try and do:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>shed some light on a fairly deep/fundamental motivation i have (that i think is misguided)</li>
            <li>try to identify the deeper reason leading to #1</li>
            <li>find an alternative to #1 that still follows from #2</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            this "deep motivation" that i am suspect of, i would describe as a desire for certainty, a desire to fully understand things, or a desire to know everything. and the problem is... i'm pretty sure it's not possible to get any of those things. so i find myself in this place where i'm deeply motivated to strive for something impossible to reach.
        </p>
        <p>
            unfortunately my brain explodes when i try to think about how to move forward from this. i'm trying to write in such abstract generalities... it would be good to try and pay attention to concrete, specific situations where i have actually bumped into this difficulty in real life.
        </p>
        <p>
            departing from the initial plan i made for this post, i will leave us with a list of "good to remembers" for the future.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>i still know *some* things, even if i don't know *every*thing.</li>
            <li>truth is important even if it doesn't end up being the ultimate thing</li>
            <li>just because something is messy does not mean it must be discarded</li>
        </ul>
        <p>-s</p>
