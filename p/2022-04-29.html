it's always kind of remarkable how when doing some types of things time feels like it passes really slow but when doing other types of things it feels like it passes really fast. it's hard for me to recall all of the different moments in my life where time has felt either fast or slow, but i'm going to try and think of some of the more obvious examples in my memory... for one, time seems to feel fast when doing highly focused activities, times when a task's difficulty is right at the edge of my ability, like when i'm learning a new thing and am just starting to get the hang of it. coming out of a state like this, i will be shocked to realize that hours have passed, when it has only felt like an hour, tops. alternatively, i think that time feels as though it is passing slowest when i am waiting, fixated on something i want badly. whether that be to pee, leave work, or for food to arrive at a restaurant.
</p>
<p>
i think this points toward the reality that our mind does not directly sense the passing of time, but instead senses some sort of ongoing process in our brain and uses that to approximate the passage of time. in retrospect, this seems somewhat obvious... how could the brain sense the passage of time directly? in fact, there is no way, even with advanced technology, to directly measure how fast time passes. be it the rotation of the earth around the sun, the oscillation of a pendulum, or the oscillation of a caesium-133 atom, we must assume some event that keeps happening, repeats with a constant period. in the case of our brain, i think we realize that our immediate perception of time is off, when we are confronted with the greater reality of a more trustworthy clock. this can, of course, mean a literal clock... like "oh shit it's <em>11pm</em>!". but it can also mean a greater internal clock "i'm so <em>tired</em> i can't believe it got late so fast!", or can also be a greater external clock "i can't belive it's already <em>dark!</em>". These three examples, a mechincal clock, our circadian clock, or the sun itself, are recognized to be greater approximations of the passage of time compared to what i guess i'll call our "dirty clock". i tried wikipedia-ing what this lesser internal clock might be called by other more important people but i couldn't come up with something definative... so i'm going to keep calling it our dirty clock.
</p>
<p>
it's intersting to think about what mechanism our dirty clock relies on in order to estimate the passing of time. clearly whatever it is relying on is pretty significantly impacted by our mental state and the activies we are engaging in. (seems like a bad plan... must not have been any better options). so i guess this tells me that nothing in our brain regularly repeats at intervals smaller than like 12 hours... and that the thing that does function the most consistently has quite a bit of variability. having a worthwile metranome in our noggin just didn't end up in the cards for us.
