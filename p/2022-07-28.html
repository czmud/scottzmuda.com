        <p>
    i've had this thought for awhile, that my near-sightedness (myopia) might be a consequence of using my eyes up close too much and not using them for far away stuff often enough. this got me thinking about how i could formulate some sort of practice in which i would train them to start working far away again. but as i kept thinking about this, i realized that my near-sightedness may be not so much a disorder, but an adaptation to the lifestyle i have thus far chosen. if i live my life in a way that does not demand my eyes to look far away, then why should they maintain the ability to do so?
</p>
<p>
    my current conclusion is that if i want to regain my sight, it's going to require me to not find a shortcut, but to change the way i live. i must live more emersed in the outside world, less hyperfocused on tiny details up close.
</p>
<p>
    unfortunately, the conditions of this thinking are the same conditions that can lead to self-deception. obviously i don't like to not be able to see far away very well. so something that would give me hope that this could be changed would tend to prey on this desire. well... let's hope i'm not wrong.
