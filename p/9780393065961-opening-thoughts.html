i believe that 'life ascending' is a book that i have been looking for for some time. i've wanted a book that gives a principled overview of the most important patterns which make the foundation of life, patterns both big and small. nick identifies ten of these very patterns and dedicates one chapter to each: the origin of life, dna, photosynthesis, the complex cell, sex, movement, sight, hot blood, consciousness, and death. part of why i'm attracted to this book is because many of these biological patterns resonate throughout humanity's understanding of the universe itself. the biblical writers, for example, invoke biological metaphors almost ad nauseam, insisting that the spiritual form of life, death, the masculine, and the feminine are not just metaphors of their biological counterparts but that the biological forms are but an echo of the truer spiritual reality of these -quite a claim! also central to existence (spiritual or otherwise) is energy. and while somewhat obscured in the table of contents, i have no doubt that energy will be a central idea in the chapters treating photosynthesis, the complex cell, and i can only assume multiple others. i guess what i'm saying is that i expect there to be deep reasons why certain patterns are foundational to life and that these deep reasons might have implications beyond the strictly biological. wish me luck!
