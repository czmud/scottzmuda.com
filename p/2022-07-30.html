    i have reason to believe that life extends in proportion to its ability to live. if a being seems to not directly extend itself across time (by reproducing), it is strong evidence that it is a member of a greater being. and this greater being both benefits from its member and takes on the responsibility of extending its member. the greater being takes on this responsibility by redistributing reproduction to other members. thus, some members are disproportionately responsible for reproduction to allow for those that do not reproduce at all. this "specialization" or "organization" will continue to develop and balance in a way that extends life most generally.
