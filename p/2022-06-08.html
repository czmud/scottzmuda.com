        <p>
        i think in language, there is both a high-dimensional field of form (the "directions") and a high-dimensional field of matter (the "destination"). think about the sentence "i hit a bat out of the air with a bat." the first form of "bat" gives directions to the destination matter 'a nocturnal, flying mammal' while the second form of "bat" gives directions to the destination matter 'an implement with a handle used for hitting a ball in games'. obviously, the spelling of the two forms (coincidentally shared) is entirely insufficient for giving directions to their respective destination matters, more dimensions must be considered. 
        </p>
        <p>
        at a given moment in history, sets of highly related forms will give directions to destination sets of highly related matters. note how in the above example the first "bat" and the second "bat" would not be contained in the same set of highly related forms despite their shared spelling. these "sets of highly related forms" i think are more or less what we consider as "words" and these "sets of highly related matters" i think are more or less what we consider "senses".

        ok, this is looking real nice to talk next about how metaphors fit into the whole mess.
