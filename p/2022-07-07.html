after reading over and thinking more about my previous post (<a href="/p/2022-06-08.html">2022-06-08</a>) i have decided that i would like to find a better approach. i was trying to get at how the meaning of a word can drift over time and even split into multiple related but distinct meanings, but i felt like i tried using some pretty weird words that made things hard to understand. i was also trying to understand how the meaning of a word could expand to include strictly abstract senses (i.e. metaphor). so instead of thinking solely in terms of words mapping to meanings, i am going to try and include how words and meanings are used more functionally.
</p>
<p>
so functionally, it is clear that in the overwhelming majority of instances, words are used with other people in social contexts. the most simple case being when there is communication from just one person to another. let's say that a person has some idea that they want to communicate; to encode this idea into words, the speaker accounts for the shared context of the conversation and chooses to speak in a way that takes the least amount of energy while still successfully communicating the intended idea.
</p>
<p>
difficulty arises when there is no word for an idea that someone wants to communicate. how can we speak about something for which we have no word? i believe the strategy to address this problem depends on what is available in the shared context of the conversation. if the idea relates to some immediately available sensory perception, i think we can basically just make whatever sound we want that "feels right" and these noises will easily be associated with the idea by the listener as they can both hear the word for something and experience that thing at the same time. for example: "the water is 'splooshy'" or "that spider is 'eenie weenie'". if however, the idea the speaker wants to communicate is not immediately available in the context of the conversation, then we can't just make up a word but instead have to rely on other already known words to help make the idea clear.
</p>
<p>
the idea represented by a known word and the idea we don't have a word for should have important overlapping characteristics or aspects. we can call this action of using a word in a new way a "transfer", "re-appropriation", or "carrying over" of a word from one idea to another. we can call this action metaphor.
