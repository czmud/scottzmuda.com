        <p>
            i think a helpful way to understand the taste perception of "umami" or "savoriness" (as opposed to sweetness, bitterness, sourness, and saltiness) is to see that while this perception ultimately serves the purpose of aiding in the acquirement of protein generally, the perception of savoriness disproportionately detects a single protein constituent: the amino acid glutamic acid. it's plausible that this reliance on glutamic acid is due to the relative ease of its detection compared to the other amino acids. with this benefit comes a tradeoff: the risk of a false positive for the attainment of protein generally (a complete amino acid profile). this, to me, seems to be the danger of monosodium glutamate (msg). this additive isolates the one amino acid that is disproportionately detected by savory taste receptors. this is important because the perception of savoriness is not ultimately for pleasure but to optimize the securement of logistical resources for the body. msg added to food may negatively disrupt this central feedback mechanism and diminish the ability to effectively estimate the amount of complete protein consumed.

            analogously, i think this risk is present in communities which develop specialized vocabularies for their respective interests. while the utilization of specialized words ultimately serves the purpose of communicating valuable and helpful ideas, the use of these words can degenerately be summoned when correlates to the valued ideas are instead present.

            didn't quite finish this idea but getting tired of writing... also, trying to draw a careful analogy between language and taste is pretty mentally taxing. perhaps i will revisit later and refine.
