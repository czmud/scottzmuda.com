		    i think a helpful way to understand the taste perception of "umami" 
            or "savoriness" (as opposed to sweetness, bitterness, sourness, and saltiness) 
            is to see that while this perception ultimately serves the purpose of aiding in 
            the acquirement of protein generally, the perception of savoriness 
            disproportionately detects a single protein constituent: the amino acid 
            glutamic acid. it's plausible that this reliance on glutamic acid is due to the 
            relative ease of its detection compared to the other amino acids. with this 
            benefit comes a tradeoff: the risk of a false positive for the attainment of 
            protein generally (a complete amino acid profile). this, to me, seems to be the 
            danger of monosodium glutamate (msg). this additive isolates the one amino acid 
            that is disproportionately detected by savory taste receptors. this is important 
            because the perception of savoriness is not ultimately for pleasure but to 
            optimize the securement of logistical resources for the body. msg added to food 
            may negatively disrupt this central feedback mechanism and diminish the ability 
            to effectively estimate the amount of complete protein consumed.

            analogously, i think this risk is present in communities which develop specialized 
            vocabularies for their respective interests. while the utilization of specialized 
            words ultimately serves the purpose of communicating valuable and helpful ideas, 
            the use of these words can degenerately be summoned when correlates to the valued 
            ideas are instead present.
            </p>

            didn't quite finish this idea but getting tired of writing... also, trying to draw 
            a careful analogy between language and taste is pretty mentally taxing. perhaps i 
            will revisit later and refine.
