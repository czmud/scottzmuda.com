dear reader dear me,
</p>
<p>
i am going to offer you a positive motivation for embracing church, which i hope you will give a chance and think pretty hard about.
</p>
<p>
i feel the need to do this because i believe the current form of church is going to die and i would like the next form to emerge sooner rather than later. maybe i can help with that in a small way.
</p>
<p>
if we don’t do this i think we will learn our lesson the very hard way (all of us might be biologically dead at that point but still… the children!)
</p>
<p>
really the basis of my argument is going to be that the church (religion) is uniquely able to connect us all together. and i think you, dear reader dear me, should want that.
</p>
<p>
i think this is like the difference between being a bacteria and being a cheetah or an oak tree. if we think that one single cell of a plant or animal is roughly the same as a single-celled bacteria… there is an obvious best choice. i’m not saying the bacteria isn’t important or doesn’t matter, but part of life is about pushing toward greatness.
</p>
<p>
i think church is uniquely able to connect us because it gives us access to the deepest parts of ourselves and to the strongest forms of sacredness. i just don’t see other forms of relationship getting close to this.
</p>
<p>
so depending on where you are coming from i’m sure you will have different reflexive responses to this.
</p>
<p>
some, i think, will recoil at the idea of church… probably having more bad feelings toward it than good. to you i would say: “yep, right on”. like i said, i think the current form of church is dying. and i think you might be more sensitive to the symptoms of the looming death.
</p>
<p>
one sign of death is probably our obsession with certainty. it seems obvious that our understanding of ourselves, of others, of the world, and of God puts a hard limit on our ability to understand the bible. what i see in the dying church is an obsession with trying to apply the bible to life in certain and absolute terms. when we do this, i think we communicate an unspoken presumption of understanding ourselves with certainty, others with certainty, the world with certainty, and God with certainty. obviously an absurd (and violent!) presumption to make.
</p>
<p>
another sign of death is probably our abandonment of feeling. it seems obvious that feeling is the proper counterbalance to thinking. that when feeling goes too far it violates thinking and when thinking goes too far it violates feeling. what i see in the dying church is the oppression of thinking over feeling. how comfortable have we become letting our understanding of good conflict with our understanding of God?! the cries of our feelings have been too often ignored.
</p>
<p>
so i would say this… if you are sensitive to these symptoms of death we really need you in the church to help. we need you to help embody the counterbalance that is feeling and to help embrace the mystery.
</p>
<p>
so that’s one response. another might be some sort of recoil or resistance to the framing of my words. you might have more good feelings toward church than bad feelings. to you i would say “yep, right on”. while i do think the current form of church is dying, it’s not dead yet!
</p>
<p>
one sign of life is probably the connectivity that still remains within the church. what i have seen in the life of church have been us coming alive within the connection to ourselves, each other, God, and even the world. what a waste it would be to loose such a valuable way of relating to each other.
</p>
<p>
another sign of life is probably the beauty of so many who lean into the church. such kindness and love must not be ignored. there is such sweetness in all that lies underneath the thoughts and ideas we hold. the love we give is powerful and beautiful despite our more heady commitments
</p>
<p>
so, dear reader dear me, i think we are called to this journey together. to save and cultivate the life that remains while overcoming the death and decay. i think this will be very difficult for whoever chooses to embark —for the death is truly daunting. but i think the potential for life is so much greater.
</p>
<p>
p.s. some of you might have wanted me to mention Jesus. …well now i did : )
</p>
<p>
love,<br>
