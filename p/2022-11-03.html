<div>
    about to leave my place, but hoping to rip out a quick post before doing so. i've been reflecting lately on a feeling that i've been having during some conversations.
</div>
<p>
    sometimes this feeling rises up inside me and then subsides like a swelling wave in the ocean that never breaks. and sometimes this feeling raises it's head and demands to be known. regardless, this feeling of mine is not happy with me. it is a feeling like there is not enough air in the conversation. and that i gasp for it as soon as it becomes available. it is a feeling of veiled desperation, of trying hold on to more than i can handle.
</p> 

<p>
    i think i know a big part of the reason this feeling is not happy with me but it would be vain to speak on it here.
<p>
    i'll say this... this feeling of mine is telling me to be someone a little different than what i've had in mind. i suppose i will listen.
